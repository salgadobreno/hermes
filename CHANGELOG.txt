## [Unreleased][unreleased]
### Changed
- Some classes and packages have been reorganized in a move to have better separation between what is AQRT API and what

- QrSetup parameter in QrTokenCode creation was made @Nullable, defaulting to Error Correction Level L

### Added
- A new 'API' profile was included to the POM that will create a JAR that excludes all the GUI packages so it can be added
